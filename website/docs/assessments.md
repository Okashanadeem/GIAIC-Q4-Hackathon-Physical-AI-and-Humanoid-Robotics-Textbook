# Assessments

This course employs a project-based assessment approach to ensure students gain practical experience and demonstrate mastery of the concepts.

## Core Assessment Components:

*   **ROS 2 Package Development Project**: Students will develop a ROS 2 package to control a simulated robotic system, demonstrating their understanding of ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, and services.

*   **Gazebo Simulation Implementation**: Students will create and configure a Gazebo simulation environment, including robot models (URDF/SDF), physics settings, and sensor simulations, showcasing their ability to build and interact with digital twins.

*   **Isaac-based Perception Pipeline**: Students will implement a perception pipeline using NVIDIA Isaac tools, focusing on tasks such as VSLAM, object detection, or synthetic data generation, demonstrating their skills in advanced AI for robotics.

*   **Capstone: Simulated Humanoid Robot with Conversational AI**: The culminating project requires students to integrate all learned modules to create an autonomous humanoid robot in simulation. This involves receiving voice commands, cognitive planning with LLMs to translate commands into ROS 2 actions, path planning, obstacle navigation, object identification, and manipulation.
